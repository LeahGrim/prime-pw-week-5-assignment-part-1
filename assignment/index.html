    <h1>Leah's Week 5 Assignment - Part 1</h1>
    <p>Here we go, let's check the console for output.</p>
    <div class= 'introduction' >
    <h3>
      <lo> Hello, I'm Opal and the contents of this assignment are all about me </lo>

    </div>

    <div class = "questions" >
      <h2>
        <ul> <li> When I run the code and look at my console, it looks like the
                  console lists all of my object properties in alphabetical order.
                  Is there a way that I can see the object properties on the console
                  in the same order that I listed them in my js file? </ul> </li>
        <ul> <li> Could I run into potential issues if the string for two properties are the same?
                  For example, firstName is Opal, while the favoriteColor is also Opal (on line 70) </ul> </li>
    </div>
